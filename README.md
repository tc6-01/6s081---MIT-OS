## 6s081.OS
This is a brief document of this project.
### branch
There have many branches, which all of them stands for one lab. Here what I want to introduce is how to add this branches into you repo.
#### create or select one your repo
the first step you need todo is to select one repo so that we can add the initial repo into it.
#### add remote selection
here we already have the mit repo source,  and we can add our source repo into the remote
```bash
    $ git remote add [name(whatever)] [your-repo-address]
    $ git merge -m <meassage>
    $ git push name
```
after this, we finish the add operation. And we can switch the main repo as well as update our code into our repo.
### usage
These labs are useful for you to remember the os service, if you want to understand the kernal/user mode or other base theory. 
And you can take examples the (xv6books)[https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/xv6/book-riscv-rev2.pdf]

If you have trouble in finishing them, you can pull issules in this repo.

Good Luck!!!
